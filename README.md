This site uses modern techniques to capture and render the [model of the 1855 New York and Erie Railroad diagram](https://www.loc.gov/item/2017586274/) by D. C. McCallum and G. H. Henshaw.

I use the original icons, which adds some complication,but illustrates the flexibility of the D3/Graphviz combination.
